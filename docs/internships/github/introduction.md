IncubateIND is sponsoring the [2021 GitHub Externship](https://github-externships.github.io/externship/index.html) and [The Palisadoes Foundation](http://www.palisadoes.org) has applied as a participating organization. (We are awaiting confirmation. These GitHub Externship pages are preparatory.) This page is your entry point to our program. Please watch this page for updates concerning our participating in 2021.

### About Talawa

The Palisadoes Foundation has been sponsoring work on this open-source project for a number of years. We hope to launch it in alpha at the end of the summer. Talawa is a modular open source project to help community-based organizations such as clubs, neighborhood groups, volunteer associations, non-profits and small religious institutions manage their daily activities. Most user interaction is via a mobile app.
